                    <p>Below are three brief descriptions of who Penguin Articles is, in both
                        professional and personal point of views.

                    <p>Throughout our history, Penguin's covered many stories, both personal
                        and professional. However, as individuals and an
                         article company we've made sure to always
                        ask permission before publishing a story, even before we established
                        ourselves as a professional group of writers.

                    <p>
                        We've said it many times before and will eventually do so again. Penguin Articles
                        is what we call ourselves, and what we do is cover stories and events taking
                        place around the local schools.
                        
                        But why is it we do what we do here? Could it
                        be that we want to bring awareness to parents and other caregivers that may
                        not know all the goings on? Or is it to expose some deep secret behind closed
                        doors in these schools? Simply put, we enjoy writing and listening! We take
                        passion in hearing about other's experiences and letting them know we're here
                        for them, as we want to make their concerns known to all, should they desire.

                <h2 class="h2botimg">Who our crew is</h2>

                    <a href=""><img src="img/whothecrewis.png" alt="Who we are"></a>
                    <p>Originally, we were just high school students that had problems of our
                        own. We all became friends through sharing our struggles and lending
                        a hand to one another, which then came the idea of "If we could do this
                        for other students, maybe they won't feel so left out or alone" giving
                        rise to what we truly wanted to do, share stories! So from then on, we
                        began to write stories about other's experiences, to hopefully let other
                        struggling students know they're not alone in what they're dealing with.
