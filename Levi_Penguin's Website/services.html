                        about? Sumbit a story to us, and we'll see if the material
                        is worth publishing! Also, while we do appreciate your
                        stories, but do try to keep said 
                        material PG-13. Cheers! (Note: Upon story submission,

                    <p>Is there an article that's raised more questions than

                        However the case, if you feel there's something about
                        an article that we've published that doesn't sit well
                        with you, feel free to send us a feedback form and let
                        us know what we should've done better.

                    <p>Although at the time of publishing our articles,
                        developments of the stories we cover may occur faster
                        than we can write about. Most of the time we're able
                        to update our stories with great urgency, but should that
                        not be so, this is where you may inquire about
                        developments on an article that has an ongoing story.
